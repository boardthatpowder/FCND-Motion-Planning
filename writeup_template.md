# Required Steps for a Passing Submission:
1. Load the 2.5D map in the colliders.csv file describing the environment.
2. Discretize the environment into a grid or graph representation.
3. Define the start and goal locations.
4. Perform a search using A* or other search algorithm.
5. Use a collinearity test or ray tracing method (like Bresenham) to remove unnecessary waypoints.
6. Return waypoints in local ECEF coordinates (format for `self.all_waypoints` is [N, E, altitude, heading], where the droneâ€™s start location corresponds to [0, 0, 0, 0].
7. Write it up.
8. Congratulations!  Your Done!

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---
### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

You're reading it! Below I describe how I addressed each rubric point and where in my code each point is handled.

### Explain the Starter Code

#### 1. Explain the functionality of what's provided in `motion_planning.py` and `planning_utils.py`

The `motion_planning.py` includes the main `MotionPlanning` class which is accountable for guiding the drone along a path. Upon start, it registers 3 callbacks listening to the `LOCAL_POSITION`, `LOCAL_VELOCITY` and `STATE` events. The various states of the drone form a state machine comprised of `MANUAL` > `ARMING` > `PLANNING` > `TAKEOFF` > `WAYPOINT` > `LANDING` > `DISARMING` > `MANUAL`.

Upon a `LOCAL_POSITION` event received, the flight state is checked. If `TAKEOFF` and the local position is within 5% of the target the state is updated to `WAYPOINT` along with the drone commanded to fly to the first waypoint.

Upon a `LOCAL_VELOCITY` event received, the flight state is checked to see if the state is `LANDING`. If so, and the position is within 0.1 of a grid cell, and the altitude 0.01 of the ground, the drone is disarmed.

Upon a `STATE` event received, if the drone is in mission and the state is one of `MANUAL`, `ARMING` (and armed), `PLANNING`, or `DISARMING` (and not armed or guided), the state machine as described previously is transitioned.

The functionality that occurs on each state change event is as follows:
| State From | Guard | State To |
| === | === | === | === |
| `MANUAL` | in mission. | `ARMING` | 
| `ARMING` | in mission, and armed. | `PLANNING` |
| `PLANNING` | in mission. | `TAKEOFF` |
| `DISARMING` | in mission, not armed, and not guided. | `MANUAL` |

The last piece of this class that needs explanation is the `plan_path()` method. At this moment it is a skeleton outline of how to plan the path with implementation outstanding which will be completed as part of this project.

The `planning_utils.py` script contains a number of functions/enum related to areas of flight that we have previosuly implemented something similar as part of past lessons:
- `create_grid()` - Returns a grid representation of a 2D configuration space based on given obstacle data, drone altitude and safety distance arguments.
- `Action` enum - encapsulates the delta of the action and the associated cost of each possible action of navigating a grid.
- `valid_actions()` - Returns a list of valid actions given a grid and current node.
- `a_star()` - An implementation of the _a*_ algorithm to find a path from a start to a goal while avoiding obstacles within a grid.
- `heurestic()` - A hueristic cost function based on Manhatton distance.



### Implementing Your Path Planning Algorithm

#### 1. Set your global home position
*Here students should read the first line of the csv file, extract lat0 and lon0 as floating point values and use the self.set_home_position() method to set global home. Explain briefly how you accomplished this in your code.*

The 1st line of the `colliders.csv` file contains a latitude and longitude which are the coordinates of the center of the map. This is in the format of `lat0 <latitude>, lon0 <longitude>`. Within the code I opened the file, read the first line, then split the string appropriately to retrieve the latitude and longitude values. These were then passed ` self.set_home_position(lon0, lat0, 0)` to initialize the home position.

#### 2. Set your current local position
*Here as long as you successfully determine your local position relative to global home you'll be all set. Explain briefly how you accomplished this in your code.*

#### 3. Set grid start position from local position
This is another step in adding flexibility to the start location. As long as it works you're good to go!

#### 4. Set grid goal position from geodetic coords
This step is to add flexibility to the desired goal location. Should be able to choose any (lat, lon) within the map and have it rendered to a goal location on the grid.

#### 5. Modify A* to include diagonal motion (or replace A* altogether)
Minimal requirement here is to modify the code in planning_utils() to update the A* implementation to include diagonal motions on the grid that have a cost of sqrt(2), but more creative solutions are welcome. Explain the code you used to accomplish this step.

#### 6. Cull waypoints 
For this step you can use a collinearity test or ray tracing method like Bresenham. The idea is simply to prune your path of unnecessary waypoints. Explain the code you used to accomplish this step.



### Execute the flight
#### 1. Does it work?
It works!

### Double check that you've met specifications for each of the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view) points.
  
# Extra Challenges: Real World Planning

For an extra challenge, consider implementing some of the techniques described in the "Real World Planning" lesson. You could try implementing a vehicle model to take dynamic constraints into account, or implement a replanning method to invoke if you get off course or encounter unexpected obstacles.
